haciendas cafeteras colombianas:\nDéjate seducir por la tierra del café por excelencia, sus paisajes de verde intenso, su gente cálida... y relájate en una auténtica hacienda cafetera colombiana donde es posible aislarse del ruido y el estrés cotidiano para disfrutar del sonido de la naturaleza mientras respiras el delicioso aroma cafetero de esta bella tierra.\n\nDescubre las haciendas cafeteras colombianas, una de las herencias coloniales más coloridas del Paisaje Cultural Cafetero:\nLas haciendas son uno de los elementos arquitectónicos más característicos de la cultura cafetera, herencia de los antioqueños. La experiencia se inicia admirando estas edificaciones de amplios corredores y paredes construidas en bahareque, decoradas con vivos colores vivos que las hacen destacar entre tanta naturaleza. Conocerás la historia que encierra la hacienda mientras degustas un verdadero café colombiano de bienvenida.\nEscoge la hacienda o finca que más se adapta a tu perfil:\nSi quieres vivir una experiencia más confortable, alójate en algunas de las haciendas con mayor encanto y comodidad. Si prefieres un alojamiento más auténtico, aunque esto signifique sacrificar algo de confort, escoge alguna de las fincas que alquilan 2-3 habitaciones, donde compartirás morada con los propietarios, siendo uno más de la familia.\nDescansa y relájate en un entorno privilegiado de naturaleza:\nPasea plácidamente por alguno de los senderos de la hacienda, probando deliciosa fruta, disfrutando con el paisaje, la exuberante vegetación, los grandes árboles nativos y especies de aves endémicas, mientras te fascinas con la gran explosión de colores que ofrecen las diferentes especies de plantas que enmarcan las haciendas.

cafetero en transportes auténticos:\nVive el Paisaje de una forma distinta, a bordo de un Jeep Willys, de un \"Karpati\", de una Chiva de vivos colores o incluso de un jeep panorámico. Estos transportes te permitirán recorrer fácilmente las tierras cafeteras mientras descubres el origen de una taza de café, conoces pueblos con encanto y admiras el maravilloso e inconfundible paisaje de los cafetales. \nSiéntete como uno más en el desfile de «Yipaos»:\nSi viajas en junio o julio tendrás la oportunidad única de contemplar decenas de «yipaos» desfilando por las calles de Calarcá, una población pintoresca que baila al son de los rugidos de los «Jeep Willys». Podrás ver las diferentes cargas que pueden llevar los yipaos», desde productos como el café o plátanos hasta muebles, plantas y mascotas. Diviértete viendo el concurso del «pique», donde «yipaos» cargados hasta los topes se ponen a dos ruedas para recorrer unos metros y arrancar aplausos del público.\n\nManizales, mirador de tierras cafeteras:\nEn Manizales literalmente sentirás que estás andando sobre una cuchilla, con calles en prolongadas pendientes a ambos lados, y es que es un mirador natural perfecto.

de la naturaleza y paisajes únicos:\nEsta región está atravesada por la cordillera de los Andes lo que te permite ascender a más de 4.000 metros de altura. Si eres un amante de la naturaleza, podrás disfrutar de paisajes únicos y practicar una amplia variedad de actividades con distintos niveles de dificultad. En el Paisaje Cultural Cafetero de Colombia observarás paisajes volcánicos y ecosistemas tan singulares como el páramo. Este telón de fondo es también un paraíso para las aves, con más de 1.000 especies.\nLas palmas más altas del planeta:\nEl mero hecho de estar en el Valle del Cocora o el Bosque de la Samaria te hará sentir un privilegiado. El paisaje, incomparable, este bosque sobre bosque, como solía decir Alexander Von Humbolt, te traslada a una era remota, casi esperando que un ser extinto aparezca rugiendo de entre la bruma. Las palmas, especie en vía de extinción, de hasta 60 m, esbeltas y desafiantes te invitan a adentrarte en su misterio y descubrir un escenario repleto de vida y un abanico de parajes.\nSúbete a bordo de un «Yipao» en el coqueto pueblo de Salento\nSalento es un auténtico pueblo cafetero con encanto, con sus coloridos balcones y bonitas tiendas. Dirígete al Mirador Alto de la Cruz, que te regalará una espectacular vista del Valle, dejándote sin palabras. Súbete a un «Yipao» y dirígete al impresionante Valle del Cocora.\nPasea entre gigantes y descubre a los más pequeños:\nA pie o a caballo, seguirás agradables senderos que te situarán al lado de altísimas palmas, que son al mismo tiempo madrinas de especies amenazadas como el loro orejiamarillo. Te dirigirás a la Reserva la Montaña, donde podrás entrar en contacto con su ecosistema rico en flora y fauna. La Montaña es un mirador natural de este paisaje único y del misterioso Cerro Morrogacho. Otra excelente opción es continuar adentrándose en el bosque de niebla hasta llegar a la Reserva Natural de Acaime, conocida por sus coloridos colibríes, bromelias, orquideas, helechos y otras
