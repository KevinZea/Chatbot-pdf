 Atractivos turísticos:\n\nPLAZA DE BOLÍVAR:\nLa céntrica plaza localizada entre las calles 20 y 21 y las carreras 13 y 14, fue uno de los primeros lugares creados por los antiguos colonizadores. Esta plaza ha sido objeto de varias transformaciones a través del tiempo y actual- mente es sitio obligado de visita en la ciudad, por las construcciones de sus alrededores y porque estando allí resulta cómodo programar un paseo pea- tonal por la zona histórica y comercial de Armenia.\nEn la plaza sobresalen la catedral de la Inmaculada Concepción, el edificio de la Gobernación del Quindío y el monumento Al esfuerzo, obra que el maestro antioqueño Rodrigo Arenas Betancourt esculpió inspirado en la laboriosidad de los hombres y las mujeres de la región. También es admirable la escultura de El Libertador, obra del maestro quindiano Roberto Henao Buriticá, destacado maestro con gran auge en la primera mitad del siglo XX.\nEI paseo en la plaza de Bolívar se complementa con el disfrute de los agradables cafés que hay en las calles aledañas, lugares ideales para acercarse a la tradición quindiana por la vía de deliciosas bebidas y recetas del suave fruto.\nMUSEO DEL ORO QUIMBAYA\nParte del tesoro recuperado de la otrora cultura quimbaya se custodia en este museo de invaluable significado arquitectónico, histórico y cultural puesto al servicio en 1986. El edificio responde a un diseño del arquitecto bogotano Rogelio Salmona, quien con su reconocido virtuosismo en el uso del ladrillo, creó el moderno espacio con terrazas, salas de exposición y jardines exteriores que emulan modelos prehispánicos por la colección de arboles, frutales nativos y plantas medicinales e industriales, usadas por antiguos pobladores. Los jardines están incluidos dentro del plan pedagógico que adelanta permanentemente el museo.\nLa colección principal del Museo del Oro Quimbaya se compone de piezas orfebres y cerámicas correspondientes a los hallazgos arqueológicos del Cauca Medio, donde los Quimbayas fueron los principales artífices. De otra parte el museo provee espacios importantes de formación para niños y jóvenes, y adicionalmente para artistas reconocidos o promisorias figuras de las artes plásticas y la pintura.\nDesde el punto de vista arquitectónico, el Museo del Oro Quimbaya es un edificio de terracota especie de arcilla endurecida al horno que fue construido con varias clases de tabletas y ladrillo donde, según los expertos, se aprecia una fascinante interacción entre el agua y la forma.\n\n\nPARQUE DE LA VIDA:\nComplejo natural de 8 ha donado a la ciudad por la Federación Nacional de Ca- feteros y la Gobernación del Quindio. Es un espacio arborizado con senderos en adoquln, lago, cascada, puentes de gua- dua, patinódromo, concha acústica y ex- tensas praderas que sirven de escenario para el descanso y la contemplación de la naturaleza.\nSe distinguen en el lugar los llamados patios quindianos, cuatro módulos en granito, encerrados en vigas de madera o chambranas y con corredores y bancas, en los que eventualmente se organizan eventos como ferias artesanales. El parque hace honor a su nombre por la tranquilidad que se experimenta al re- correrlo y por la confluencia de agua, árboles, flores y especies animales que se mueven en total libertad. Abierto de lunes a viernes de 8:00 a.m. a 6:00 p.m., fines de semana y festivos de 8:00 a.m. a 7:00 p.m. Cra. 13 cal/e 8 norte. @ (6) 7462302\nANTIGUA ESTACIÓN DEL FERROCARRIL\nTambién conocida como Centro Cultural Metropolitano La Estación, es una de las construcciones más simbólicas de Armenia por su estilo republicano y el buen estado de la estructura, donde en la actualidad funciona una biblioteca pública y algunas oficinas municipales. En esta obra que data del año 1927, se aprecian los sobrios detalles en yeso y las formas en hierro que caracterizan portales, ventanas y terrazas. La emblemática edificación, que fue declarada patrimonio nacional en 1989, alberga eventualmente acontecimientos culturales como exposiciones de arte. Cra. 19 No. 29 – 30. @ (6) 7449296/ 7411355\nAntigua estación del ferrocarril.\nMIRADOR LA SECRETA\nEscenario de conservación ambiental también conocido como el mirador de la 18, una de las avenidas mas transitadas de Armenia. Desde este lugar se aprecia el cañón del río Quindío que se forma con el marco de las montañas de la cordillera Central y el cerro de Peñas Blancas que pertenece al municipio de Calarcá Ubicación: Cra. 18 calles 35 a la 40.\nCENTRO COMERCIAL DE CIELOS ABIERTOS\nSon nueve cuadras a lo largo de la carrera 14 entres las calles 12 y 21, en las que se sugiere un recorrido exclusivamente peatonal por entre un variado comercio conformado por almacenes de ropa, cafés, restaurantes y entidades financieras.\nEste complejo que ha servido para recuperar el espacio público, une la plaza de Bolívar con el parque Sucre a través de un amable y tranquilo paseo que transcurre en pleno centro de la ciudad. Además de las compras para hacer, resulta un placer acudir a los distintos cafés apostados en la vía, la mayoría con originales ambientes, y algunos con el valor agregado de exponer al visitante la preparación de los productos de la carta. Cra. 14 entre calles 12 y 21.\nMURALES\nPintura y grabado en madera y cemento son algunas de las tecnicas y elementos usados por varios artistas del Quindío para hacer de los espacios de Armenia galerías permanentes a la vista de toda clase de público. El maestro Henry Villada Tamayo es uno de los artistas, que en tal sentido, mas aportes le ha hecho a la ciudad.\nPARQUE SUCRE\nUn espacio recuperado y remodelado para la ciudad y sus habitantes, que hace parte del conjunto de obras del proyecto Cielos Abiertos. Además del bronce del prócer de la independencia Antonio José de Sucre y del busto de la poetisa Carmelina Soto, en eI parque hay un estanque con peces, amplias zonas verdes y varias clases de árboles sembrados, entre los que sobresale una inmensa ceiba y un agradable café al aire libre donde eI grano, ya tostado y molido, es el principal ingrediente en una amplia carta de bebidas. El parque cuenta con una adecuada batería sanitaria. Cra. 13y 14, cal/es 12y 13.\nTEMPLO DE SAN FRANCISCO DE ASÍS.\nPor la historia que conserva, es considerado la obra religiosa más importante de la ciudad. Inicialmente fue una pequeña capilla en el año 1929, y tras Ia construcción del convento de los franciscanos, en 1937 inició el levantamiento de Ia nueva iglesia terminada hacia 1949, Cra. 18 cl. 1 esquina.\nCANOPY LOS CARACOLÍES\nArmenia es aventura en su área rural gracias a la infraestructura para la practica de Canopy en el complejo Los Caracolíes. Por entre el bosque nativo primario en el que predominan los arboles que dan nombre al lugar, se ha diseñado un circuito con 10 vuelos y 16 plataformas; en total son 1.900 m de vertiginoso re- corrido, que ademas regala un emocionante encuentro con Ia naturaleza propia quindiana.

Allí se ven el tronco y el hacha, elementos alusivos al trabajo y al mismo tiempo remembranza de los labriegos que llegaron para fundar la ciudad. Un lugar amable de reunión y esparcimiento, Carreras 73 y 74, cal/es 7 a 4 norte,\nTemplo del Sagrado Corazón de Jesús.\nConocido popularmente como Ia iglesia de piedra, este recinto existente desde 1939, es producto del esfuerzo de muchos fieles que transportaron en la década de los treinta, toneladas de piedra del río Quindío para que se pudiera edificar un diseño del arquitecto italiano Albano Germanetti. EI trabajo tuvo Ia dirección del ingeniero de la región Carlos Augusto Agudelo. Cra. 21, entre cal/es 19 y 20.\nTEATRO AZUL\nEl prolífico artista caldense Luis Gui- llermo Vallejo transformó la fachada de este lugar en un soberbio lienzo bauti- zado por él mismo como Almas unidas. Es una atractiva obra de arte con pre- dominio del color azul que ocupa todas las paredes y techos externos de la edi- ficación. Un proyecto original único en Suramérica, que causa impacto entre quienes visitan los alrededores del parque Sucre. Cra.13 cl. 11 esquina (6) 7450709. teatroazul@hotmail. com.\nARTESANÍAS\nEn Armenia se concentra el ingnio de los artesanos locales y regionales que ma- terializan sus ideas en la guadua, Ia ces- tería y otras fibras naturales. Muchos de los artífices quindianos se inspiran en eI cafe como tema y materia prima para Ia creación de sus trabajos. Además de los materiales tradicionales, desde hace al- gunos años en Armenia un grupo de per- sonas viene trabajando sobre el tarralí, una especie de calabazo o totumo, que una vez seco, se somete a un proceso de pintura y decoración. El resultado li- naI son coloridos y útiles adornos y ac- cesorios. Informes: (6) 7450524.\nBARRANQUISMO\nCon la tierra y los barrancos como materia prima, el obrero Efrén Hernández esculpió varias obras que engalanan algunas zonas de la ciudad y que están inspiradas esencialmente en figuras precolombinas. Una vez moldeadas las obras, el autor las finalizó con arena y cemento, creando una especie de museo natural callejero que es objeto de admiración entre caminantes y viajeros.\nTres grandes esculturas conforman Ia colección, siendo una novedosa expresión deI arte urbano con el sello original de su autor. Una de las obras se llama Diálogos de pensamiento y se halla en la entrada oriente de Ia ciudad; Ia segunda se ubica en la avenida Bolívar y lleva por título Alegoría al agua; mientras que la tercera de las esculturas, sobre la avenida Ancízar López, es como una representación de Armenia en la que se juntan una réplica de la catedral, un poporo y varias figuras como máscaras, caimanes y penachos de águila.\nMONUMENTO LA LOCOMOTORA\nLa segunda locomotora que llegó al departamento del Quindio por la ruta del puerto de Buenaventura, es hoy un emblema restaurado que se destaca en la glorieta Alfredo Vásquez Cobo en la salida hacia Pereira.

Atractivos turísticos\n\nCERRO DE LAS TRES CRUCES\nEs uno de los varios puntos altos de la localidad situado en la vereda La Granja. Por su posición clave que domina el panorama, el cerro es objetivo de peregrinaciones religiosas, plataforma de despeje para vuelos en parapente y mirador natural de varias localidades de la zona.\nCAFÉ SAN ALBERTO\nEl lugar es una creativa sorpresa instalada sobre las montañas cafeteras que caracterizan a Buenavista. Allí se diseñó la terraza que hace parte de una tinca cafetera en la que se siembra y se pro- cesa el grano, el cual es sometido a rigurosos controles de calidad para producir cafe especial tipo premium, bien sea empacado o servido en una taza.\nVisitar este cafe resulta un placer y la experiencia inigualable de observar el trabajo de familias caficultoras, al tiempo que se avista, con el marco del valle del río Barragán, el propio paisaje que provee los frutos de la deliciosa bebida. Se recomienda hacer larga la visita para observar los hermosos atardeceres.\nEn el Café San Alberto las alternativas del visitante van desde tomar una taza y contemplar el panorama, hasta caminar por los cafetales con la guía de expertos conocedores que enseñan sobre el proceso y desarrollan un tour de calado, para involucrar los sentidos.

Atractivos turísticos\n\nARQUITECTURA TRADICIONAL\nEn Calarcá se inició un proceso de recuperación del patrimonio que busca destacar la historia de los personajes y del pueblo a través del inventario arquitectónico de más de 80 viviendas, cuyas fachadas fueron embellecidas, pero en las que se ha mantenido su concepción original. Se propone un recorrido por cerca de 30 casas ubicadas en el marco del parque central y las manzanas aledañas, donde una señalización interpretativa a través de placas, da cuenta de sus antiguos residentes y poseedores.\nEn la lista de dichos recintos aparecen algunas del parque Bolívar, la llamada casa de las Téllez, el edificio de la Alcaldía Municipal, el Hospital de la Misericordia, la casa de el antiguo  restaurante Bakho y la Escuela Rafael Uribe Uribe.\nLa plaza de Bolivar, totalmente reno- vada, se caracteriza por los espacios amplios con senderos peatonales, bancas, jardineras y algunos árboles nativos. Y como complemento, un conjunto urbanístico que conjuga las características tradicionales del pueblo con algunos rasgos de modernización.\nDe otro lado, la sede de la Alcaldía Municipal, anteriormente edificio del Banco Central Hipotecario, es una casa que hace parte del inventario arquitectónico heredado dela colonización antioqueña. Allí son de admirar los amplios pasillos, el patio central y los detalles en puertas y ventanas que resaltan el buen estado de la construcción, la cual se im- pone con su belleza en un costado del parque principal de Calarca. Así mismo, en el marco del parque central se halla la casa de las Téllez, con nombre cambiante según los propietarios que ha tenido a través de su historia. Se destaca porque a pesar de ser una construcción centenaria se conserva el estilo de la colonización.\nJARDÍN BOTÁNICO DEL QUINDÍO Y MARIPOSARIO\nPersonas amables y capacitadas le guiarán por esta reserva de 15 hectáreas, ubicada sobre la vía al Valle del Cauca en la salida del municipio de Calarca. El jardín conserva colecciones de plantas medicinales, cactus, heliconias y jardines, entre muchas clases de flora regional. Hay ademas un insectario, reservas de bosques nativos y una replica del túnel de la Línea.\nLas instalaciones del Jardín Botánico del Quindío se conocen por a través de recorridos didácticos por senderos ecológicos y gracias a la generosa vista que se aprecia desde el puente colgante o el mirador de siete pisos de altura; desde allí se ve una panorámica del jardín, y especialmente se distingue la forma del Mariposario. Además de las investigaciones y la labor pedagógica adelantada, el jardín ofrece, entre otros servicios, los de cafeteria, tienda de artesanias, biblioteca y vivero. Av. Centenario 75-790 km 3 vía al Valle del Cauca.\n\n\n\nFIESTA NACIONAL DEL CAFÉ\nA finales de junio, coincidiendo con el puente festivo de San Pedro y San Pablo, en Calarcá se lleva a cabo la que es calificada Ia festividad más importante del Quindío. Dentro de los actos programados sobresale el Reinado Nacional del Café, cita de candidatas de todas las regiones colombianas, quienes mas allá de su hermosura, deben demostrar su bagaje sobre el tema cafetero. La ganadora obtiene el derecho de representar a Colombia en el Reinado Internacional del Café de Manizales.\nPero la Fiesta Nacional del Café es ademas una masiva manifestación social que refleja costumbres regionales gracias a una plural programación que motiva la participación de adultos, jóvenes y niños, quienes, a propósito, tienen su espacio en las Rondas Cafeteras.\nDESFILE DEL YIPAO\nUno de las competencias que causa mayor expectativa es el Concurso y Desfile del Yipao, en el que estos clásicos carros se exhiben por las calles de Calarcá. La prueba tiene premiación en cuatro categorías: transporte de productos agrícolas, trasteo tradicional de corotos, categoría libre con personas o carga y modalidad de pique, un reto a la destreza del conductor.\nRECUCA – RECORRIDO DE LA CULTURA CAFETERA\nCon una palabra coloquial que define la sigla y lo llamativo del plan, Recuca significa entrar a una autentica ﬁnca cafetera para conocer y aprender todo acerca del proceso del cafe; desde la historia y el cultivo, hasta la molienda y la preparación. Y es que entrar al lugar obliga a usar el traje de recolector y asumir las tareas de quien arduamente trabaja para que el cate colombiano este calificado entre los de más alta calidad a nivel mundial.\nEn las montañas que cercan el municipio y sobre los terrenos en los que se cree reposan los restos del cacique indígena Calarcá, están el cerro Peñas Blancas y el ecoparque construido para el desarrollo de actividades ecoturísticas y de deportes extremos. A 1 km del corregimiento La Virginia, en el prominente cerro se juntan las condiciones para llevar a cabo caminatas ecológicas, escalada en roca, rappel y espeleísmo. Como servicios opcionales, se ofrece hospedaje y alimentación.\nPUENTE COLGANTE DON NICOLÁS\nAntiguo viaducto que unía a Calarcá con Armenia, apreciable desde el mirador de la 18 o La Secreta en la capital quindiana. Además de la estructura llama la atención la panorámica del rio Quindío rodeado de guaduales. La obra actual, poco transitada y con espacio para el paso de un carro a la vez, responde a un diseño del ingeniero alemán Guillermo Ledher, a quien le fue encomendada la tarea de reemplazar el viejo paso que habían construido los vecinos valiéndose de tablas y cables de acero.\nDEPORTES DE AVENTURA\nQuindio es un importante destino nacional para el turismo de deportes de aventura. Precisamente los alrededores del municipio de Calarcá como Peñas Blancas, el corregimiento de Barcelona y el Rancho California en Barragán son los principales sitios regionales en los que se practican, entre otras actividades: parapente, rafting, kayak, Cabalgatas, rappel, juegos de cuerdas altas, escalada en roca, caminatas y jeep panorámico.\nPARAPENTE.\nEl cerro El Castillo de la cordillera Central en Calarcá es el escenario propicio para liberarse a las emociones del deporte que emula las aves, en un concierto de emociones y panorámicas maravillosas de tres departamentos, pues además del Quindío, desde lo alto se divisan vastos sectores de Risaralda y el Valle del Cauca. Se realizan vuelos deportivos y comerciales o tándem, que son aquellos en los que el turista va acompañado de un experto piloto certificado por la Federación Colombiana de Deportes Aéreos.

Atractivos turísticos\n\nCEMENTERIO LIBRE\nLa idea fue de un grupo de hombres librepensadores que decidieron hacer un cementerio para el pueblo en general. Es único en América Latina y está catalogado como un monumento a la libertad, la tolerancia y el amor. A la entrada se levanta un busto en honor a su fundador, Braulio Botero Londoño. El campo santo, nació como respuesta a las imposiciones de una época en la que “sólo se permitía pensar de rodillas ante el clero y los caciques”.\nCuenta la historia que en la década de los veinte del siglo pasado, las libertades estaban amordazadas al punto de que quedaban insepultos los cadáveres de quienes no habían cumplido en vida con los requisitos religiosos. Era tan cruel la sociedad de aquel entonces, que a la cárcel iban a parar quienes enterraban a sus parientes fuera de los cementerios exclusivamente administrados por la curia. Esas, entre otras razones, fundamentaron la obra que fue construida en un terreno donado por Miguel Botero Bernal, mientras que el artífice del diseño fue Antonio Schieferl, un alemán radicado en Circasia.\nPARQUE BOLÍVAR\nEs el sector de mayor movimiento y punto de encuentro de los habitantes de Circasia. Sobre las vías se estacionan los viejos Willys que transportan a la gente a las veredas cercanas y en sus cuadras se observa la arquitectura antioqueña que predominó en el siglo pasado. Se destaca la cuadra del costado oriental con varias y coloridas casas en cuyas fachadas resaltan los bonitos balcones. Al terminar el paseo por el parque, nada mejor que probarla rica fritanga que expenden allí o tomar el provocativo sorbete de guanábana, chirimoya y chocolate granulado.\n\n\n\n\nMIRADOR TURÍSTICO ALTO DE LA CRUZ\nSe trata de una construcción en madera de aproximadamente 15 m de altura a la que se puede acceder para obtener una linda vista del pueblo y sus alrededores. Para levantar el mirador se escogió el alto dela Cruz por ser el más elevado del casco urbano.\nMUSEO HISTÓRICO CIPRIANO ECHEVERRY\nFue en el período republicano, entre 1880 y 1930, que se construyó esta vieja casona.

Atractivos turisticos\n\nCASCADAS DE RÍO VERDE\nEn la vereda Río Verde Alto, distante 22 km del casco urbano de Córdoba, se desprenden tres caídas naturales de alturas diferentes y separadas entre sí por distancias muy cortas. Las cascadas que nacen del río Verde pasan por el paraje llamado La Persia, además cada una tiene también su respectivo nombre: Las Brisas, Las Mellizas y La Linda. El entorno es uno de los tesoros paisajísticos más valiosos de Córdoba, un rincón para la admiración y el silencio.\nPARQUE CENTRAL\nFue bautizado Jose’ Maria Córdova en memoria del prócer antioqueño cuya escultura emerge en la parte central. Dadas las características en declive del terreno, el parque se diseñó con un sistema de terrazas unidas por escaleras de cemento y ladrillo, con jardineras a su alrededor.\nCENTRO NACIONAL PARA EL ESTUDIO DEL BAMBÚ GUADUA\nDesde el mismo instante de la entrada, la visita al centro es un completo recorrido por todo lo inherente a la guadua, una clasificación del bambú asiático que hay en la zona cafetera, y especialmente en el Quindío, el terreno apropiado para que crezca y se reproduzca; y donde las gentes han logrado el mejor aprovechamiento de dicho árbol maderable.\nEn el centro para el estudio dela guadua se programan recorridos guiados y se adelantan investigaciones que se traducen en capacitaciones para agricultores, profesionales y estudiantes interesados en el tema de la silvicultura. Aparte de recorrer los senderos, es recomendable que visite la casa de guadua y la exposición permanente de artesanías en esta versátil madera, a la que por tal cualidad se le han dado múltiples usos.\nARTESANÍAS EN GUADUA\nSon muchas las familias que dedican su tiempo al diseño y fabricación de distintos elementos y accesorios de guadua.

Atractivos turísticos\n\nMIRADOR COLINA ILUMINADA DEL QUINDÍO\nFue construido en mangle del Caribe y otras maderas de Ia región como el zapan y macana. Es una torre erigida sobre las pendientes de las afueras de la localidad en la via que conduce a Quimbaya, representando el sitio ideal para observar la panorámica de Filandia y 360° de hermosos parajes. En días despejados se ven casi todos los pueblos del Quindio, la ciudad de Pereira en Risaralda y algunos pueblos del norte del Valle del Cauca. El mirador tiene una altura de 27 m y es el resultado de un esfuerzo de la Gobernación del Quindío que impulsó la ejecución de la obra para el aprovechamiento de las características geográficas del municipio.\nCuenta con varios balcones para el avistamiento del paisaje y con un café que abre los fines de semana. Adicionalmente, en el piso interior de la torre se destaca la figura en retales de vidrio y espejo de una mariposa azul, cuya vista desde la parte alta es tan llamativa como el panorama que rodea al mirador. Se puede visitar cualquier día, pero son los fines de semana y los festivos los de mayor afluencia. Horario: 10:00 a.m. a 7:00 p.m. y hasta las 9:00 p.m., los fines de semana.\nPARQUE CENTRAL DE FILANDIA\nDestino principal donde confluyen los nativos del pueblo, los viajeros, los arrieros y los yipaos. Aquí se marcan senderos entre jardines y bancas, y algunos quioscos en los que venden refrescantes jugos naturales, ensaladas de frutas y salpicones, En las cuadras que lo rodean se aprecian bellas casas de los primeros pobladores, hay varios cafes y algunos restaurantes.\nTEMPLO MARÍA INMACULADA\nCon algunas reparaciones, este templo fue construido esencialmente mediante la técnica del bahareque y con madera de cedro y laurel, materiales que se aprecian en su interior y en la secuencia de columnas que lo caracterizan. Sobresale desde 1905, año de su fundación, a un costado del parque principal y sobre la calle séptima.\nCONJUNTO ARQUITECTÓNICO\nLa calle del Tiempo Detenido, al norte de la plaza central, tomó su nombre porque las viviendas que están a lado y lado, con excepción de los arreglos necesarios, se han mantenido en su estructura y aspecto original. Junto a las construcciones que se levantan en las cuadras de la plaza central, estas tradicionales casas son consideradas una valiosa muestra del legado antioqueño que predominó en la fundación de los pueblos. Se destaca también el Colegio Bethlemitas con sus extensos pasillos y balcones, la institución es fiel reflejo del estilo arquitectónico impuesto por los antiguos colonizadores. La Ruta Arquitectónica, de la cual hace parte Filandia, es un recorrido por los municipios de Calarcá, Salento y Pijao que el visitante no debe perderse.\nARTESANÍAS Y EL BARRIO SAN JOSÉ\nAdemás de la agricultura, en Filandia es reconocido el trabajo en cesteria de sus artesanos. Familias enteras concentradas en el barrio San José, principalmente, dedican sus días a tejer canastas, baúles, bolsos, lámparas y todo cuanto la imaginación les permita. Para crear sus inventarios, los artesanos se valen de distintas ﬁbras extraídas de la zona como el yaret, la calceta de plátano o el mimbre. El barrio San José se encuentra sobre la vía al mirador Colina iluminada, la misma que lleva a al municipio de Quimbaya. También en el costado suroriental de la plaza central está el almacén administrado por la Asociación de Artesanos.\nARCHIVO FOTOGRÁFICO\nSe trata de un recorrido por la historia de Filandia mediante la exposición de más de dos mil fotografías. Su artífice es Jorge Arango, un quindiano empeñado en recuperar la memoria de los principales hechos que han marcado el destino de la población. Se ubica a una cuadra del parque central en la casa del Artesano.\nRESERVA NATURAL BREMEN – LA POPA\nSobre la margen izquierda de la carretera que va a Filandia desde la Autopista del Café, se halla esta reserva natural com- partida por los departamentos de Quindío y Risaralda. Es un area de conservación con predominio de bosques de pino y eucalipto y una extensión de 1.200 ha, de las cuales se han habilitado algo más de 700 para su reconocimiento a través de senderos interpretativos, Además de la belleza paisajística, la reserva es una importante fuente de agua que surte a ocho mu- nicipios de Quindío, Risaralda y Valle del Cauca, gracias a las cuencas de los ríos Barbas, Roble, Cestilla, Consota y Boquía. Así mismo, en Bremen – La Popa se fomenta el desarrollo del turismo regional y se promueve la educación ambiental a través de la investigación y el conocimiento de la biota.\nCAÑÓN DEL RÍO BARBAS\nEste paraje y la reserva Bremen están separados por la vía principal que llega a Filandia desde Armenia, y ambos lugares se unen por corredores biológicos que los visitantes pueden cruzar para apreciar los recursos naturales gracias a las jornadas pedagógicas que adelantan las autoridades ambientales. El cañón del río Barbas, cuya fuente esta a 2.200 m.s.n.m. , en el alto Morro Azul, se localiza en la cordillera Central y es hábitat de varias especies endémicas de fauna y otras con presencia importante como el mono aullador.

De las diversas especies que allí habitan, entre endémicas y casi endémicas, se destacan el solitario andino, el barranquero coronado, el tucancito culirrojo, el carriqui de montaña y el trogón Collarejo. Informes: Fundación Ornitológica del Quindío. (6) 7535 7 7 8 –  371 7788322\nSENDERO ECOHISTÓRICO\nComprende una fracción del antiguo ca- mino nacional que comunicaba a Bogotá con Cartago. Lo componen varios tramos entre los 4 km y los 5,5 km y que incluyen el paso por varios atractivos naturales e históricos. La fundación de Filandia, la existencia de los indios quimbayas y el paso de la campaña liberta- dora son, entre otros, algunos de los hechos relevantes que se recrean a través de esta especial forma de hacer senderismo.\nMONUMENTO JESÚS RESUCITADO\nLa escultura de Jesus resucitado, obra del maestro Jairo Bedoya, representa el fervor religioso de los habitantes de Filandia.

Atractivos turísticos\n\nPARQUE CENTRAL\nEn el parque se refleja la vida laboriosa y tranquila del municipio. Está dotado de bancas, espacios peatonales y rutas por donde los niños juegan y pasan en sus bicicletas. En un costado, y al frente de la iglesia, se erige la estatua del Libertador Simón Bolívar.\nTORREFACTORA DE CAFÉ\nEste lugar es como el sueño hecho realidad para los caficultores de Génova, ya que les permite procesar el grano a través de una moderna maquinaria industrial con la cual aumentará la producción de un café listo para consumir. La torrefactora significa mejores ingresos para el campesinado, y para los visitantes, la oportunidad de conocer el proceso cafetero. Pronto el pueblo de Génova presentará al mundo su propia marca.\n\n\n\nIGLESIA DE SAN JOSÉ\nEn una de las esquinas del parque, sobre la carrera décima, sobresalen la parroquia del municipio con su nave central y dos torres laterales que parecen competir en altura con una palma del parque y las lomas que encierran el pueblo. Como dato particular, la construcción de la iglesia a mediados del siglo XX, contó con la participación de los fieles genoveses. Aprecie las exclusivas tallas en bronce de las puertas y ascienda al mirador parroquial y la torre del reloj.\nLAGUNA DE JUNTAS\nLa laguna de Juntas está inmersa entre un valle en la parte más alta del municipio y a varias horas de caminata.

Atractivos turísticos\n\nARQUITECTURA TRADICIONAL\nLas fachadas, los portales, las ventanas y los balcones decorados con flores, reflejan cómo Pijao mantiene la tradición en su arquitectura. Las bien conservadas construcciones son apreciables en las calles principales y en el marco del parque central, donde predominan los típicos cafetines con máquinas de origen italiano que preparan y mantienen fresco el café que se toman los contertulios habituales y los que llegan de paso.\nPijao, Salento, Calarcá y Filandia son considerados los pueblos más bellos del departamento y están presentados dentro de Ia ruta de pueblos típicos, que cada vez cobra mayor importancia para los viajantes. Dentro de ese plan de recuperación de la memoria arquitectónica, cerca de una veintena de fachadas fueron recuperadas con el apoyo de las autoridades municipales y departamentales, y el trabajo decidido de los residentes de cada lugar.\nPAISAJES NATURALES\nEn muchos rincones que rodean a Pijao se evidencian las razones de por qué al lugar se Le conoce como jardín turístico de Colombia. A través de jornadas ecológicas se llega a sitios como el monte Mameyal, el cerro Tarapacá, el páramo de Chilí, el mirador La Mariela y el valle de las Mariposas por eI sendero Los Gavilanes.

Atractivos turísticos\n\nPARQUE NACIONAL DE LA CULTURA AGROPECUARIA – PANACA\nLa visita a este parque temático constituye una divertida manera de aprender sobre las labores del campo. A través de sus ocho estaciones el lugar señala la dinámica relación entre los visitantes y los más de 4.500 animales que se cuidan en el complejo. Entrenamiento canino, ganadería, porcicultura, agronomía y cuidado equino, son algunos de los temas documentados durante el recorrido por Panaca, Es importante llegar a primera hora para conocer todas las atracciones y servicios que se brindan. Imprescindible ir a las entretenidas carreras de cerditos y a las exhibiciones de perros y caballos amaestrados, En las estaciones es posible alimentar a los animales; pasear sobre algunos de ellos; dar tetero a los cerdos y las cabras; ordeñar las vacas y asistir a una divertida obra de teatro que recrea la importancia del campo.\nSeguro los niños, y de paso los adultos, nunca olvidarán la gallina y la paloma más pequeñas del mundo, el toro hermafrodita, el caballo miniatura y las 47 razas de perros amaestrados, Hay patos, conejos, búfalos, pájaros y muchos otros animales en lo que se ha convertido como la finca de los colombianos. Todo en el lugar hace parte de un compromiso para llevar un mensaje a los asistentes en el sentido de que las ciudades dependen del campo, y por lo tanto, del manejo responsable de la tierra, la fauna y los recursos naturales.\nLos avestruces ocupan otro atractivo espacio de Panaca, al que llegan las personas a contemplarlos, alimentarlos y a valerse de ellos para participar en las simpáticas carreras que se organizan en el avestruzódromo.\nRESERVA NATURAL LA MONTAÑA DEL OCASO\nCon el permiso previo de la Universidad del Quindio, se ingresa a esta reserva boscosa de 106 ha en la que el mono aullador es el principal habitante. Se estima que en la zona hay más de 200 de estos primates agrupados en 12 manadas. Es una de las pocas selvas de la zona cafe- tera con un boyante inventario de biota, en el que esta incluido un número significativo de especies de orquídeas, aves, mariposas, serpientes e insectos. La reserva se halla en la vereda El Laurel sobre la via Montenegro — Quimbaya.\nPARQUE BOLÍVAR\nEs el principal sitio de referencia del casco urbano, donde Ia escultura del Libertador, la catedral, algunas casas típicas y el estacionamiento permanente de los yipaos obligan a una amena caminata. La plaza esta entre las carreras 5 y 6 con las calles 15 y 16.\nTEMPLO JESÚS, MARÍA Y JOSÉ\nEn el frontis de la torre central de esta iglesia causa grata impresión el Cristo de la esperanza, una obra esculpida por Buenaventura Malagón, avanzado discipulo del maestro Rodrigo Arenas Betancourt. Con casi diez metros de altura, el Cristo esta catalogado como uno de los mas grandes de América Latina, hecho que es motivo de orgullo para los habitantes de Quimbaya.\nALDEA DEL ARTESANO\nCamino a Panaca, es una amplia casa con jardín, un pequeño vivero y ventanales a través de los cuales se ilumina naturalmente la obra de más de cuarenta artesanos que se congregan allí para diseñar y exponer una diversidad de artÍculos y accesorios que reflejan su creatividad y que se materializan en plata, guadua, totumo, cerámica y tagua, entre otras materias primas. La observación del trabajo que se adelanta en la aldea y la adquisición de uno de los múltiples elementos es plan obligado para hacerse a un bonito emblema de Quimbaya.\n\nPEQUEÑA GRANJA DE MAMÁ LULÚ\nEn el entorno de cultivos agrícolas y la fauna doméstica, una familia de la region diseñó este proyecto auto sostenible donde se producen los alimentos para el consumo diario de los habitantes de la casa y de quienes los visitan atraídos por el interés de saber cómo se vive con suficiencia en el campo. La granja integral facilita los servicios de hospedaje, restaurante y de charlas didácticas que dictan los anfitriones sobre temas ecológicos y agropecuarios.\nBALSAJE\nEs una de las actividades preteridas por os visitantes al Quindío, región pionera en Colombia con esta torma de navegar que emula la movilización por el rio que hacían los antiguos indígenas. El plan inicia en el pueblo de Quimbaya, por lo general a bordo de un clásico jeep Wi- llys hasta la vereda Puerto Alejandría, el punto de embarque.\nCon chalecos salvavidas y bogas experimentados, empieza una plácida y emocionante experiencia sobre las rústicas balsas hechas en guadua, en los tramos navegables del río La Vieja. La actividad del balsaje permite conocer uno de los principales ríos quindianos y la abundante vegetación que lo enmarca. En Quimbaya hay que preguntar por las em- presas organizadoras del plan, que por lo general incluye transporte en yipao, el préstamo de los accesorios de seguridad y fiambre, almuerzo típico de la zona servido en hojas de plátano. La duración del recorrido es hasta de cuatro horas.\nFESTIVAL DE VELAS Y FAROLES EN QUIMBAYA\nLa tradicional noche de las velitas y la fiesta en honor a la Virgen de la Inmaculada Concepción son el motivo principal, para que todas las familias de Quimbaya, se manifiesten con ingenio durante el evento festivo, cultural y religioso que se lleva a cabo los días 7 y 8 de diciembre de cada año. Durante el festival, el pueblo se llena de luz y color gracias a los miles de faroles elaborados en cartón, papel, vidrio y cerámica. Los residentes de cada cuadra forman un solo equipo para crear un diseño común de farol y de esta manera participar en el concurso que al final premia la calle más original y vistosa.

Atractivos turísticos\n\nPARQUE PRINCIPAL\nEsta enmarcado por casas típicas de vivas tonalidades en las que funcionan la Alcaldía, los despachos municipales, cafés, restaurantes y comercio en general. A un costado se impone el templo Nuestra Señora del Carmen, y en el centro, entre bancas y jardines, la estatua de Simón Bolivar. El lugar es todo un con- junto pictórico que concentra la apacible vida del pueblo.\nOtra llamativa característica en los alrededores del parque la aportan los clásicos yipaos que inician muy temprano el desfile desde y hacia las veredas aledañas; como es costumbre, cargados hasta los espejos de pasajeros, café, plátano e inimaginables acarreos.\nCALLE REAL\nInicia en uno de los vértices de la plaza rumbo norte hacia el mirador Alto de la Cruz. Se trata de la calle mejor conservada con el protagonismo de casas típicas y alegres que le han merecido a Salento estar entre los pueblos más lindos de Colombia. En ella se da la confluencia de un amplio mercado artesanal, de restaurantes, cafés y hostales que con sus productos y servicios constituyen el alma comercial de la municipalidad. Dichos sitios resultan propicios para adquirir muy buenos recuerdos, artesanías en guadua, y en general, gran cantidad de artículos como ruanas, sombreros, pulseras o collares. Se le llama calle Real porque era allí donde vivían las personas más ricas e influyentes del pueblo.\nEl recorrido turístico en Salento se complementa con el placer de disfrutar la gastronomía tradicional. Gracias a la existencia de muchos criaderos, la trucha en sus distintas presentaciones es el plato más famoso del pueblo.\nECOPARQUE EL MIRADOR\nEs punto obligado de visita porque desde allí se observa el valle de Cocora que nace entre las montañas de la cordillera Central y se desliza paralelo al río Quindío; es posible llegar en carro y estacionarlo en el parqueadero del lugar, que además tiene baño público. La estructura, en forma de balcón, está construida en guadua, representando así una óptima tribuna para admirar el paisaje, incluso a través de algunos telescopios que alquilan los lugareños. Desde el mirador parte un corto sendero que une al mirador con el alto de la Cruz. Allí venden ricos dulces, miel de abejas, obleas y canelazos para el frío. La mejor forma de llegar es preguntando a cualquier habitante.\nVALLE DE COCORA\nPor una vía pavimentada casi en su totalidad se emprende el recorrido hacia esta reserva natural que constituye uno de los escenarios más representativos del Quindío. Hospedajes típicos, criaderos de truchas y más de tres mil clases de plantas aparecen paulatinamente en un camino ascendente de valles y montañas hasta la tierra donde crece la famosa palma de cera (Ceroxylon quindiuense), única de su categoría que se reproduce en clima frío y con altura de hasta 60 m.\nEl valle del Cocora, localizado 10 km al norte de Salento, comprende alturas que van desde los 1.800 m hasta los 2.400 m, presentando al mismo tiempo variaciones ambientales de clima medio y frío. La temperatura baja, aún más, cuando por esta ruta se accede al Parque Nacional Natural Los Nevados.\nEl recorrido en el valle transita paralelo al rio Quindío que nace en la cordillera Central. El punto de llegada es La Truchera, donde varios restaurantes sorprenden gratamente con distintas preparaciones de trucha. Allí mismo se contrata el ser- vicio de guías para las salidas ecológicas y se alquilan los caballos. Hay distintos planes que duran desde 3 hasta 8 horas, dependiendo de las distancias y del tiempo disponible del viajante.\nLos atractivos cercanos son Morrogacho, el bosque de niebla, Acaime, Estrella de Agua, entre otros.\nUna gran diversidad de fauna, y hasta criaderos de toros de lidia, se aprecian en inmediaciones del valle de Cocora, que debe su nombre al símil del sonido que produce una de las especies de aves que lo habitan.\nTour por Salento y el Valle de Cocora en Jeep Panorámico: Ver información y tarifas.\nPROCESO DEL CAFE Y COFFEE TOUR EN FINCA HOTEL EL OCASO\nLa Finca El Ocaso se encuentra ubicada en un alto a tan solo 4km de Salento (20 minutos en carro o una hora caminando),  con un paisaje único rodeado de montañas y adornado por el murmullo del Río Quindío que pasa bordeando la finca cuesta abajo a 300 m. La Finca El Ocaso cuenta con una casa típica cafetera con mas de 100 años de historia y tradición donde se presta el servicio de alojamiento para un máximo de 10 personas. La finca El Ocaso tiene amplios jardines con una gran variedad de flores y árboles nativos y varias hectáreas de café.\n\nMIRADOR ALTO DE LA CRUZ\nA través de los más de 200 escalones que inician donde termina la calle Fieal de Salento se accede a este sitio que permite hacerse a una idea dela magni- tud del valle de Cocora, y que al mismo tiempo ofrece una panorámica del pue- blo. Durante los descansos del recorrido aparecen las imágenes del via crucis que recorrió Jesús rumbo al monte Cal- vario. El mirador, aparte de ser un atrac- tivo turístico, constituye un permanente destino de peregrinación.\nCERRO MORROGACHO\nEscenario previo al parque Los Nevados al que se llega solamente a pie desde el valle de Cocora y por un camino di- fícil en el que se deben tomar todas las precauciones. El cerro, de singulares ca- racterísticas morfológicas, se localiza a 3.450 m de altura, en medio de un tupido paisaje de bosque andino que lo con- vierte en uno de los destinos naturales predilectos de los quindianos. El ce- rro representa el misterio de haber sido cementerio y centro ritual de los indios quindos que otrora vivieron en la zona. Es recomendable que la expedición se haga con el acompañamiento de un guía.\nPARQUE NACIONAL NATURAL LOS NEVADOS\nTiene una extensión de 58.300 ha re- partidas en alturas que van desde los 2.600 hasta los 5.321 m.s.n.m. Es un área protegida creada en 1973 y perteneciente a varias jurisdicciones de los departamentos de Quindío, Caldas, Risaralda y Tolima; siendo el municipio de Salento el área de influencia en la parte quindiana del parque.\nLos climas son frío, de páramo y de nieves perpetuas, y las temperaturas varían entre los 14 °C y los 3°C. Sus cumbres más importantes son los nevados del Ruiz, del Tolima y Santa Isabel.\nEl parque es una importantísima fuente hídrica que alimenta, entre otras, las lagunas Verde, del Silencio y del Otún. Por el valle de Cocora se asciende siguiendo el recorrido del río Quindio hacia reservas como Acaime, Estrella de Agua, el páramo del Romeral, el valle del Placer y el páramo del Quindío.\nUna expedición a las cimas del parque Los Nevados obliga a una adecuada preparación física y logística, además de la previa autorización de la Dirección de Parque Nacionales. Informes en Bogotá @ (1) 3532400 wwwparquesnacíonales.gov.co. nevados@parquesnac¡onales.gov.co\nVEREDA BOQUÍA\nEs un importante parador en la vía an- tes de llegara Salento, con fondas y restaurantes a lado y lado de la vía, que justifican la detención para desayunar, almorzar o tomar un café amenizado por la música popular escuchada por los salentinos. El visitante podrá encontrar refugio en las posadas turísticas que allí funcionan.\nPUENTE LA EXPLANACIÓN\nHacia 1948 fue construido este paso del ferrocarril de occidente que hacía parte del proyecto vial entre Buenaventura y Bogota. Actualmente la estructura, con bases en forma de arcos, es un monumento nacional perteneciente a Ia vereda Boquía. Tambien se le conoce como puente del Amparo.\nCAMINO NACIONAL DEL QUINDÍO\nCuando en otros tiempos se requería comunicación entre oriente y occidente, este camino fue la vía de articulación más importante. Aunque desde el siglo XVIII el virrey Pedro Messia de la Cerda se interesó en su creación, sólo hasta 1823 inició la obra, mientras que en 1830 fue Simón Bolívar quien ordenó su apertura. El viejo camino se extiende entre la vereda Boquía, el río del mismo nombre y el rio Quindío.\n\nOBSERVACIÓN DE AVES\nEl cañón alto del río Quindío es hábitat de especies endémicas, casi endémicas y ejemplares que cautivan por sus colores, formas y comportamientos. En inmediaciones del valle de Cocora, cerca al cañón, se hacen caminatas gracias a las cuales se observan aves como el pato de torrentes y el mirlo de agua.\nPor esta misma ruta, subiendo a caballo, en la reserva natural Acaime habitan aves de la categoría del saltador chusquero, el perico paramuno y el pollo de monte.
