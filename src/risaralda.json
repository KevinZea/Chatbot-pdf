Religioso:\nEn Santuario se destaca la ce­lebración de la Semana Mayor, en la que sus cuadros bíblicos son representados en vivo. Los feligreses risaraldenses, con regularidad, peregrinan hacia la basílica menor Nuestra Señora de las Victorias, ubicada en Santa Rosa de Cabal, y al santuario de la Virgen del Jordán, ubi­cado en el km 7 de la vía que conduce de Pereira a Armenia.\nEn la capital del departamento es impor­tante la celebración de la Semana Santa, con un ritual que incluye imágenes de valor y belleza incalculables. Esta tradi­ción religiosa fue introducida hace más de 50 años por miembros de la co­munidad de los Misioneros Cla­retianos devotos de la Virgen María.\nEsta costumbre católica engalana las calles céntricas de la capital, con perso­najes y cuadros a la usanza española.

límites e hidrografía\nAl territorio risaraldense lo enmarcan las cordilleras andinas que atraviesan el de­partamento de sur a norte: la Central, en el oriente, y la Occidental, en el extremo occidente y en el centro de las dos cordi­lleras se forma el valle por el cual baja el Río Cauca.\nLas máximas alturas departamentales son: el nevado Santa Isabel en la cordi­llera Central, con 4.950 m.s.n.m. ; y el Ce­rro Tatamá en la cordillera Occidental, a 4.200 m.s.n.m.\nLos más grandes ríos que bañan estas tierras son el San Juan y el Cauca. El pri­mero, tiene como principal afluente al Río Tatamá y su cuenca hidrográfica ocupa el 30% del departamento. De los ríos que vierten sus aguas al océano Pacífico, el San Juan es el más caudaloso de Su­ramérica.\nEl Río Cauca por su parte, tiene como afluentes principales a los ríos: Risaralda, el Opiramá, La Vieja, Otún, Quinchía, Campo Alegre y San Fran­cisco. La cuenca hidrográfica del este comprende el 70% del territorio risaral­dense y es aprovechada en gran parte para tierras de cultivo y pastoreo.\nLa parte alta del Río Otún, situada so­bre la cordillera Central, alberga a la La­guna del Otún, madre de aguas del río que lleva el mismo nombre.

fauna y flora\nTres grandes corredores ambientales son ejes fundamentales para el ecosis­tema de la región:\nEl corredor de la cor­dillera Central, que incluye el PNN Los Nevados; el corredor de la cordillera Oc­cidental, que incluye el PNN Tatamá y el Parque Regional Natural Cuchillas de San Juan; y el corredor ambiental de los ríos Cauca y el Risaralda, de gran impor­tancia para el asentamiento de la pobla­ción y cultivo, dadas las condiciones de fertilidad de los suelos.\nEl 44% del departamento tiene una co­bertura de bosque natural y/o secunda­rio de tipo andino, subandino, altoandino y páramo. Cerca del 28% del territorio co­rresponde a cultivos semipermanentes o permanentes; el 22% a pastos; el 4% vegetación natural arbustiva; el 2% res­tante no posee cobertura vegetal, ya que son suelos urbanizados.\nRisaralda también es lugar de hábitat de pumas, osos de anteojos, dantas de pá­ramo, venados, armadillos y una gran can­tidad de especies de reptiles, anfibios y aves endémicas y migratorias, que viven en las áreas de reserva y conservación.\nEl 32% del territorio risaraldense está bajo alguna figura de protección. Ello se representa en 3 parques nacionales na­turales, 5 parques regionales naturales, 11 parques municipales naturales y 2 áreas de manejo especial étnico.\nPoblación\nEl 80% de los habitantes de Risaralda se asienta en las cabeceras municipa­les, el 20% restante vive en el campo. Los grupos humanos que pueblan este territorio son los mestizos (92%), afrocolombianos (5%), indígenas embera chamí (3%).\nPereira ha sido centro de atracción para poblaciones migrantes de otras partes del país.

temporadas de verano van de diciem­bre a febrero y de junio a agosto. El de­partamento cuenta con cinco pisos térmi­cos, desde el cálido, en los valles de los ríos San Juan, Cauca y Risaralda; hasta las nieves perpetuas, en el nevado Santa Isabel. El 60% de Risaralda está ubicado en el piso térmico templado, con tempe­raturas que oscilan entre 18 y 24 °C.\nEl clima del departamento de Risaralda está influido por las masas de aire hú­medo provenientes del Pacífico, que cho­can contra la cordillera Occidental y la depresión del río Cauca.

indígena\nEntre el año 500 a.C. hasta el 1540 d.C. los indígenas habitaron principalmente en las zonas templadas. Vivían de la agricultura, la caza, la pesca y la recolección de frutos silvestres, insectos y caracoles. Cultiva­ron maíz, fríjol y batata. Para evitar las ava­lanchas de tierra y la erosión, construye­ron canales en el sentido de la pendiente para hacer fluir el agua. Después de varios años cambiaban de lugar sus sementeras y así dejaban descansar el suelo. Además extrajeron oro y sal, hilaban, tejían y trabajaban la arcilla y los meta­les. Parte de esta producción la utiliza­ban para intercambiar con grupos veci­nos y lejanos.\nCon la llegada de los españoles, los gru­pos indígenas fueron casi exterminados, debido a la persecución y esclavitud a la que estuvieron sometidos durante la Co­lonia. Muchos murieron por el efecto de las enfermedades que trajeron consigo los invasores. Hoy, apenas el 3% de la población del departamento es de origen indígena. Es­tos descendientes aborígenes habitan en el resguardo indígena embera chamí, en el municipio de Mistrató.\nAunque la cultura aborigen fue casi ani­quilada, nombres como Tatamá, Mis­trató, Anserma,

folclor\nLos ritmos y aires musicales del territorio risaraldense quedaron delimitados y de­finidos en el siglo XIX. El compás de las gaitas y caracoles de los aborígenes se mezcló con el ritmo de los tambores afri­canos y la musicalidad de salón de la Eu­ropa monárquica del siglo XVI. Esta fu­sión de melodías dio origen al bambuco, la guabina, la danza y la contradanza.\nGran parte de la historia musical del de­partamento se escribió entre la calle 15 con carreras 6 y 7 de Pereira, en el fa­moso bar Páramo. Allí los músicos se reunían para ofrecer serenatas, creán­dose así toda una cultura del bambuco, el pasillo, el bolero y el vals, ritmos aún vigentes, pese a que el bar ya no existe.\nEl mayor representante del folclor risaral­dense, y en especial del bambuco, fue Luis Carlos González, poeta y compo­sitor.

oro\nLa cultura quimbaya, entre los siglos IV a.C y el XVI d.C, se caracterizó por el ma­nejo y dominio de una de las técnicas avanzadas de la orfebrería en el conti­nente americano. Los quimbayas elabo­raron los objetos en oro más destacados del patrimonio cultural que hoy identifica a los colombianos. Parte de estas obras se pueden apreciar en la colección del Museo del Oro de Bogotá y en el Mu­seo del Oro Quimbaya, en la vecina ciu­dad de Armenia.\nPara estos antiguos habitantes el metal era un

y su capital Pereira cuentan con una ubicación estratégica, que las convierten en un destino turístico muy llamativo a nivel nacional y para visitantes extranjeros, porque se encuentran situadas de manera equidistante a los principales centros de mercado y servicios del país.\nSu conectividad aérea garantiza operaciones diarias desde el Aeropuerto Internacional Matecaña, y por vía terrestre es posible conectarse con las capitales del eje cafetero en menos de 45 minutos, ya que está en el punto central entre las 3 ciudades que hacen parte de la región cafetera, además se conecta con las principales ciudades del país por excelentes carreteras.\nPereira es una ciudad pujante, emprendedora y cívica. La dinámica de su población, a través de la historia, la ha convertido en una ciudad pluricultural, que ofrece una cantidad ilimitada de oportunidades.\n“El que a Pereira va, siempre tendrá que volver”, reza la antigua sentencia proferida en 1870 por el padre Remigio Antonio Cañarte, en el año de la fundación.

adecuando el terreno de ladera a la siembra al igual que la de sus viviendas y adaptando la infraestructura alrededor de la producción transformación y comercialización del grano. Estas adaptaciones resultaron en unas características singulares creando una cultura especial a la que se denomina Cultura Cafetera la cual UNESCO inscribió en la Lista de Patrimonio Mundial el Paisaje Cultural Cafetero el 25 de junio de 2011. Dicho reconocimiento se basa en cuatro criterios los cuales son: Esfuerzo humano familiar generacional e histórico para la producción de un café de excelente calidad en el marco de un desarrollo humano sostenible Cultura cafetera para el mundo Capital social estratégico construido alrededor de una institucionalidad y Relación entre tradición y tecnología para garantizar la calidad y sostenibilidad del producto.

SANTARROSANO\nEl Chorizo Santarrosano tiene su origen en la fundación del municipio de Santa Rosa de Cabal cuando los habitantes entre otras actividades comerciales se dedicaron a la crianza de cerdos y los mantenían sueltos en las calles debido a las de heces esparcidas por el pueblo que producían el Alcalde de la época decretó que estos animales no podían ocupar el espacio público y que debían ser sacrificados de inmediato en vista de la gran cantidad de carne de cerdo que se obtuvo como resultado del decreto del Alcalde los habitantes decidieron hacer chorizos actividad que se convirtió en oficio y tradición del municipio y que actualmente permite que sea considerado como el mejor chorizo de Colombia.El 5 de marzo de 2011 el municipio obtuvo un reconocimiento en el Guinness Récord como el chorizo más largo del mundo alcanzando una medida de 1.917 metros de largo superando a Toluca México que hasta el momento tenía el récord con un chorizo de 1.245 metros.En Santa Rosa y sus zonas

TRADICIONAL\nLa arquitectura tradicional cafetera también conocida como Arquitectura Antioqueña fue traída a la región por colonos antioqueños en el siglo XIX inspirada y heredada por la técnica de la Tapia Pisada aprendida por los españoles. Algunas de sus características son los amplios corredores alrededor de la vivienda que por la topografía del terreno a su vez son balcones patios empedrados barandales exteriores detalles en madera como calados elaborados en madera en los portones y contraportones. Usualmente las viviendas son pintadas de colores vivos para poder ser vistas entre los cultivos y adornados con una gran variedad de flores. La técnica de construcción usada es el Bahareque la cual “es un sistema de muros construido sobre un entramado de maderas dispuestas vertical y horizontalmente con riostras inclinadas que se recubre con esterilla de guadua. Este tipo de estructura es liviano elástico muy resistente a los movimientos sísmicos. Ello le valió el término estilo temblorero”. El municipio de Santa Rosa conserva la arquitectura tradicional cafetera en especial en la Escuela Simón Bolívar La Escuela Apostólica la estación del ferrocarril y alrededor de cuatro casas que se encuentran en el bulevar del café.\nFIESTA DE LAS ARAUCARIAS\nLa Fiesta de Las Araucarias se celebra en conmemoración a la fundación del municipio que fue el 13 de octubre de 1844.\nNormalmente se lleva a cabo en el puente festivo que coincide con el día de la raza y se desarrollan duración de 4 días en los que se realizan actividades artísticas culturales recreativas y protocolarias.\n\nReciben su nombre por la importancia que tienen esas plantas para el municipio recordando que el apelativo de Santa Rosa es : “Ciudad de las Araucarias”.\nEL YIP\nEl Yip es una palabra que proviene de la marca de autos estadounidenses Jeep Willis los cuales llegaron a Colombia en la década de los 40´s y que por su fuerza y versatilidad tuvieron una mayor demanda en la zona andina cafetera ya que respondía con la exigente topografía del terreno y cumplía con la función de transportar el café hasta los centros de acopio. El nombre fue variando hasta llegar a Yip como nombre genérico de un vehículo campero 4x4 así fuera de otra marca pero que cumpliera con las características mencionadas.Hoy en día el Yip continúa prestando el servicio de transporte público interveredal para llegar a los sitios naturales y como vehículo de carga siendo éste uno de los transportes más auténticos que pueden observarse y
