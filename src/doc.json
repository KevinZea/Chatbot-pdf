conocer en Salento?. Que hacer en Salento. Que visitar en Salento. Recomendaciones en Salento\n\n*PARQUE PRINCIPAL:\nEstá enmarcado por casas típicas de vivas tonalidades en las que funcionan la Alcaldía, los despachos municipales, cafés, restaurantes y comercio en general. \nA un costado se impone el templo Nuestra Señora del Carmen, y en el centro, entre bancas y jardines, la estatua de Simón Bolívar. \nOtra llamativa característica en los alrededores del parque la aportan los clásicos yipaos que inician muy temprano el desfile desde y hacia las veredas aledañas; como es costumbre, cargados hasta los espejos de pasajeros, café, plátano e inimaginables acarreos.\n\n*IGLESIA NUESTRA SEÑORA DEL CARMEN:\nUBICACIÓN: Calle 5 frente a la plaza de bolívar.\nFue la primera parroquia en establecerse en la hoya del Quindío en 1849. Con motivo de la creación de la villa de Boquia y con el traslado del pueblo hacia su ubicación original a principios del siglo XX se empezó a levantar el templo con dos torres. A raíz de los terremotos y un incendio producidos en los años veinte la iglesia se reconstruyó con una sola torre. Fue afectada por el terremoto de 1999 la cual la llevó a que fuera remodelada con las técnicas avanzadas de construcción. Su construcción es representativa de un arte español y colombiano que combinan maravillosamente.\n\n*CALLE REAL:\nSe trata de la calle mejor conservada con el protagonismo de casas típicas y alegres que le han merecido a Salento estar entre los pueblos más lindos de Colombia. \nEn ella se da la confluencia de un amplio mercado artesanal, de restaurantes, cafés y hostales que con sus productos y servicios constituyen el alma comercial del pueblo. \nDichos sitios resultan propicios para adquirir muy buenos recuerdos, artesanías en general, gran cantidad de artículos como ruanas, sombreros, pulseras o collares.\n Se le llama calle Real porque era allí donde vivían las personas más ricas e influyentes del pueblo.\n\n*ECOPARQUE EL MIRADOR:\nEs uno de los lugares favoritos de los turistas que visitan Salento. Este sitio ofrece una vista privilegiada del Valle de Cocora, el cual es considerado uno de los paisajes más hermosos del Quindío. El mirador con forma de balcón está construido en madera y cuenta con área de estacionamiento. Un sendero conecta al Parque ecológico el Mirador con el Mirador Alto de la Cruz.\n\n*Visitar una finca de café:\nSalento está en el corazón de la región cafetera de Colombia. Es uno de los lugares más populares del país para hacer un recorrido cafetero.\nLa altitud y el clima de Salento y de toda la región del Quindío son perfectos para el cultivo de granos de Arábica, el principal tipo de café que se cultiva aquí.\n\n*MIRADOR ALTO DE LA CRUZ:\nA través de los más de 200 escalones que inicia donde termina la calle Real de Salento se accede a este sitio que permite hacerse una idea de la magnitud del valle de Cocora, y que al mismo tiempo ofrece una panorámica del pueblo. Durante los descansos del recorrido aparecen las imágenes del vía crucis que recorrió Jesús rumbo al monte Calvario. El mirador, aparte de ser un atractivo turístico, constituye un permanente destino de peregrinación.\n\n*Comer Trucha en Salento:\nLa trucha es uno de los platos más populares de la zona.\nHay una gran población de criadores de truchas y además hay truchas locales en los ríos que rodean Salento. \nEs un plato imprescindible y se puede encontrar en casi todos los menús.\nLa trucha se prepara de muchas formas: frita, a la plancha y, la más popular, acompañada de una cremosa salsa de ajo y champiñones.\n\n*Caminata a la cascada de Santa Rita:\nLa cascada se encuentra a las afueras de Salento y dura aproximadamente 1 hora antes de llegar a la Finca Santa Rita, donde comienza el sendero a la cascada. \nDesde este punto, hay unos 2 km a pie hasta la cascada. Tendrás que cruzar un puente bastante precario para llegar, pero merece la pena.\nUna vez que llegas a la cascada, es un lugar agradable para darse un baño y simplemente empaparse de naturaleza. \n\n*VALLE DE COCORA:\nDesde Salento se puede observar el imponente Valle de Cocora, uno de los paisajes más bellos del Quindío. Predomina en los alrededores la majestuosa Palma de Cera del Quindío, árbol nacional de Colombia que crece hasta 60 metros. \nEl valle del Cocora, localizado 10 km al norte de Salento, comprende alturas que van desde los 1.800 m hasta los 2.400 m, presentando al mismo tiempo variaciones ambientales de clima medio y frío. La temperatura baja, aún más, cuando por esta ruta se accede al Parque Nacional Natural Los Nevados.\nHay varias rutas de senderismo que puedes hacer en el Valle de Cocora:\n*La más corta es la de ida y vuelta. Esta caminata dura unas 2 horas y es puramente para ver las palmeras. Caminas hasta el mirador y vuelves por el mismo camino.\nSin embargo, te recomendamos que hagas el circuito completo, ya que el Valle de Cocora es mucho más que palmeras.

llegar al valle del Cocora?. LLegar al Valle del Cocora.\nLlegar al Valle de Cocora es fácil. En la plaza principal de Salento, encontrarás varios jeeps listos para llevarte allí. Puedes comprar el billete en la caseta que hay junto a los jeeps. Asegúrate de guardar bien el billete para el camino de vuelta.\nEl viaje hasta el Valle de Cocora dura unos 30 minutos y es una experiencia paisajística en sí misma. Para volver a Salento, espera al jeep donde te dejó. Otra de las opciones, si no quieres preocuparte por nada es contratar una excursión.\n\n*CERRO MORROGACHO:\nEscenario previo al parque Los Nevados al que se llega solamente a pie desde el valle de Cocora y por un camino difícil en el que se deben tomar todas las precauciones. El cerro, de singulares características morfológicas, se localiza a 3.450 m de altura, en medio de un tupido paisaje de bosque andino que lo convierte en uno de los destinos naturales predilectos de los quindianos. El cerro representa el misterio de haber sido cementerio y centro ritual de los indios quindos que otrora vivieron en la zona. Es recomendable que la expedición se haga con el acompañamiento de un guía.\n\n *PARQUE NACIONAL NATURAL LOS NEVADOS\nTiene una extensión de 58.300 ha repartidas en alturas que van desde los 2.600 hasta los 5.321 m.s.n.m. Es un área protegida creada en 1973 y perteneciente a varias jurisdicciones de los departamentos de Quindío, Caldas, Risaralda y Tolima; siendo el municipio de Salento el área de influencia en la parte quindiana del parque.\nLos climas son fríos, de páramo y de nieves perpetuas, y las temperaturas varían entre los 14 °C y los 3°C. Sus cumbres más importantes son los nevados del Ruiz, del Tolima y Santa Isabel.\nEl parque es una importantísima fuente hídrica que alimenta, entre otras, las lagunas Verde, del Silencio y del Otún. Por el valle de Cocora se asciende siguiendo el recorrido del río Quindío hacia reservas como Acaime, Estrella de Agua, el páramo del Romeral, el valle del Placer y el páramo del Quindío.\nUna expedición a las cimas del parque Los Nevados obliga a una adecuada preparación física y logística, además de la previa autorización de la Dirección de Parque Nacionales. \n\n*VEREDA BOQUÍA\nEs un importante parador en la vía antes de llegar a Salento, con fondas y restaurantes a lado y lado de la vía, que justifican la detención para desayunar, almorzar o tomar un café amenizado por la música popular escuchada por los salentinos. El visitante podrá encontrar refugio en las posadas turísticas que allí funcionan.\n\n*PUENTE LA EXPLANACIÓN\nHacia 1948 fue construido este paso del ferrocarril de occidente que hacía parte del proyecto vial entre Buenaventura y Bogotá. Actualmente la estructura, con bases en forma de arcos, es un monumento nacional perteneciente a la vereda Boquía. También se le conoce como puente del Amparo.\n\n*MUSEO ARCHIVO FOTOGRÁFICO DE SALENTO:\nUBICACIÓN: Casa Bonaire Musical, Carrera 1 Calle 6. Entrada Principal Casco Urbano.\nUn espacio que nace de la necesidad de recuperar la memoria histórica de Salento, evocada en la actividad que realizaba don Eduardo Franco, reconocido fotógrafo del pueblo entre 1977 a 2019. Con el apoyo de su familia se instala en su casa un pequeño museo con las fotografías que ya llevan recuperadas y que están a disposición de las personas que están interesadas en conocer cómo era Salento hace años atrás.\nEn cuanto al contenido del archivo, se cuenta con un registro de aproximadamente 100.000 negativos fotográficos de los cuales se han escaneado y recuperado cerca de 15.000 fotografías. Este espacio también es lugar para la realización de los ensayos de unos de grupos musicales más importantes del pueblo: el grupo Armonía Salentina.\n\n*MUSEO RELIGIOSO DE SALENTO:\nUBICACIÓN: Casa Parroquial, Enseguida de la Iglesia. Plaza Principal.\nUbicado en la Casa Cural, una de las primeras casas de bahareque y tapia que se construyeron durante el proceso de conformación de la Villa de Nueva Salento. El Museo funciona en el primer piso y en el patio central de la casa, allí se pueden apreciar diferentes esculturas, libros, fotografías, cuadros y otros ornamentos pertenecientes a la Parroquia Nuestra Señora del Carmen. Algunos de ellos actualmente son utilizados para los oficios y rituales religiosos, otros por su estado de conservación son exhibidos permanentemente en este espacio.\nEl museo busca resaltar la memoria histórica y la fe de nuestro municipio, así mismo evoca los orígenes de la primera iglesia católica erigida en el territorio quindiano y que data de 1849. El Museo Religioso funciona de Martes a Domingo de 7:00 am a 7:00 pm y el costo de la entrada es de $3.000.\n\n*OBSERVACIÓN DE AVES:\nEl cañón alto del río Quindío es hábitat de especies endémicas, casi endémicas y ejemplares que cautivan por sus colores, formas y comportamientos. En inmediaciones del valle de Cocora, cerca al cañón, se hacen caminatas gracias a las cuales se observan aves como el pato de torrentes y el mirlo de agua.\nPor esta misma ruta, subiendo a caballo, en la reserva natural Acaime habitan aves de la categoría del saltador chusquero, el perico paramuno y el pollo de monte. Otras aves especiales se observan en la senda de las reservas naturales Estrella de Agua, La Montaña y La Picota, considerado uno de los mejores corredores para la observación.\nEl tapaculo ocelado, el arrendajo montañero, el terlaque andino o el tororoi chusquero, son aves especiales que vuelan por este paisaje.\n\n*ALDEA DEL ARTESANO:\nUBICACIÓN: Afueras del Municipio. Barrio La Floresta\nEn este sitio se podrán encontrar varios talleres de artesanías donde se puede adquirir productos hechos en fibras naturales y además ver su elaboración. También es de importancia admirar el diseño de la fachada de los apartamentos en donde se resalta los valores de la arquitectura tradicional con los colores vivos y el entorno natural vecino de ellas. Además hay senderos de interpretación ambiental y allí también se pueden comprar productos agroecológicos hechos en las huertas orgánicas de la aldea.\n\n\n*Prueba la trucha al ajillo. O ahumada. O frita. Pero pruébala! \n\n*Compra un paquetito de café, es sin duda el mejor recuerdo que llevarte a casa. \n\n*Prueba el tinto colombiano (así llaman aquí al café solo) o un buen capuccino. Uno de los lugares más peculiares donde hacerlo es en el Balcón de los Recuerdos, en la esquina frente al parque, con unos balcones preciosos sobre la calle y un ambiente local

turísticos de Santa Rosa de Cabal: Que hacer en Santa Rosa. Que Conocer en Santa Rosa.\n\n*Termales de Santa Rosa de Cabal: Un ambiente natural donde potenciarás la energía tu cuerpo mientras te sumerges en cálidas aguas telúricas y alcalinas, las cuales se encuentran dentro de un complejo con diferentes amenidades como spa, masajes, restaurante, hotel y paseos hacia maravillosas cascadas.\n\n*Parque Nacional Natural Los Nevados: Este parque pertenece a los departamentos colombianos de Tolima, Risaralda, Caldas y Quindío. Se caracteriza por contar con ambientes de bosques andinos, glaciares y páramos, entre muchas otras bellezas naturales que no querrás perderte.\n\n*Parque de Las Araucarias: Zona de esparcimiento construida en 1930, provista de senderos peatonales que forman una figura de diamante. Está repleto de luminarias, bancas y zonas verdes en cuyo centro destaca un monumento al Libertador Simón Bolívar.\n\n*Basílica Menor Nuestra Señora de las Victorias: Este es un centro religioso emblemático de Santa Rosa de Cabal, donde se dan cita infinidad de viajeros para admirar su hermosa arquitectura neogótica.\nHorarios de misas: \nLUNES: 7:00 AM, 8:00 AM, 3:00 PM Y 6:30 PM\nMARTES, MIERCOLES, JUEVES Y VIERNES: 7:00 AM, 8:00 AM Y 6:30 PM\nSABADO: 7:00 AM, 8:00 AM, 12:00 hs, 5:00 PM Y 7:00 PM\nDOMINGO: 7:00 AM, 10:00 AM, 12:00 hs,  6:00 PM Y 7:00 PM\n\n*Santuario de la Medalla Milagrosa: En su imponente arquitectura destaca un hermoso vitral digno de ser admirado, al igual que la imagen de Nuestra Señora de la Milagrosa. Se trata de un Santuario Nacional localizado en la zona urbana del municipio, a unos 400 metros del Parque de las Araucanas.\n\n*Chorros de Don Lolo: Una cascada escondida dentro de una zona boscosa a 1.5 km de la vía que se dirige a las Termales de San Vicente, pasando por el cañón del Río Campoalegrito.\n\n*Baños Termales\nCon tres complejos termales rodeados de los más agraciados paisajes, Santa Rosa es la sede oficial de la relajación de Colombia. Las instalaciones más cercanas a la ciudad son Termales de Santa Rosa de Cabal y Balneario Termales, ambas situadas bajo despampanantes cascadas y alimentadas por las aguas del mismo manantial, junto al río San Ramón. Termales de Santa Rosa es el emprendimiento original e incluye un sector de hoteles, mientras que Balneario es un complejo más amplio, ideal para ir a pasar el día.\n\nUn poco más arriba en la montaña, por un camino más rústico, llegarás a la remota Reserva Termal San Vicente y comprobarás que el esfuerzo extra vale la pena. El aire en este frondoso valle es mucho más puro, y los prístinos alrededores contribuyen a la experiencia de sumergirse en las aguas minerales, y con ello, en la naturaleza. Si bien las piscinas principales están cerca del restaurante, anímate a ir un poco más allá y disfrutar de los estanques naturales en la parte baja del complejo, donde las cálidas aguas termales se unen a un fresco río en un marco de densa vegetación.\n\n*Parque Nacional Los Nevados\nEn los altos Andes sobre Santa Rosa de Cabal se emplaza la estación Potosí, una de las varias entradas al magnánimo Parque Nacional Los Nevados y el mejor lugar para iniciar la travesía a pie hasta el Nevado Santa Isabel y su glaciar de montaña, el de menor altura en todo el país. Es posible llegar al glaciar desde Santa Rosa en una excursión guiada de un solo día, pero tendrás que madrugar para lograrlo. A cambio del esfuerzo, serás premiado con vistas impagables de los espectaculares picos de todo el parque intercalados con páramos cubiertos de delicadas flores silvestres. Sin embargo, si tu objetivo es alcanzar la cima del Nevado, tendrás que pasar la noche allí.\n\nEn Potosí también nace un sendero que te conducirá a la laguna del Otún. En este ecosistema, uno de los humedales más importantes de los Andes occidentales, habitan muchas especies exóticas de aves, entre las que hallarás búhos y colibríes. Desde la laguna, podrás salir del parque por la vía alternativa de La Pastora hacia Pereira.\n\n*Consejo práctico\nLos baños termales suelen ser muy concurridos los fines de semana, pero el resto de los días seguramente los encuentres vacíos y tranquilos. Los tres complejos permanecen abiertos hasta altas horas, por lo que podrás disfrutar de un relajante chapuzón

Laguna del Otún: Un amplio cuerpo de agua situado a casi 4000 m.s.n.m. Este es el embalse de mayor importancia de la región. Tiene una extensión de alrededor de 2 kilómetros y una profundidad que supera los 70 metros. Esta obra de la naturaleza es producto de la acción volcánica y glaciar, y se mantiene gracias al deshielo que proviene del Nevado de Santa Isabel.\nEs un sitio ideal para acampar y conectarse con la naturaleza. Aquí puedes pescar truchas y observar patos, búhos, y varias clases de aves. Las aguas de la laguna se filtran bajo cavernas formadas por flujos volcánicos y dan lugar junto con la infiltración proveniente de la Laguna La Leona, al Río Otún. Este es la fuente para el acueducto de la ciudad de Pereira y los municipios aledaños.\nLa Laguna se encuentra entre Pereira y Santa Rosa de Cabal, aunque el camino de subida por la capital risaraldense resulta mucho más accesible. El recorrido es largo, usando el camino de herradura de El Cedral, el cual solo puede realizarse a pie teniendo una duración de dos días. Por eso se recomienda hacer una pausa en el camino para acampar en el punto que se conoce como La Pastora, un sector muy cerca del páramo donde se puede descansar.\n¿Cómo llegar a la laguna del otún?:\nDesde Pereira hay que tomar un bus vía La Florida – La Suiza – El Cedral hasta que termina la carretera y el paso de vehículos.

Que ver en el eje cafetero y el paisaje cultural cafetero.\n\n*Saborear el mejor café suave del mundo:\nEl Paisaje Cultural Cafetero tiene algo que hace su café único. Son cafés cultivados entre los 1.000 y 2.000 metros de altura, en suelos de origen volcánico y sobre laderas empinadas, protegidas del sol por árboles emblemáticos. Estas y otras características dan lugar a “cafés especiales”, por los que los expertos están dispuestos a pagar un precio muy elevado.\n\n*Auténticas haciendas cafeteras colombianas:\nDéjate seducir por la tierra del café por excelencia, sus paisajes de verde intenso, su gente cálida... y relájate en una auténtica hacienda cafetera colombiana donde es posible aislarse del ruido y el estrés cotidiano para disfrutar del sonido de la naturaleza mientras respiras el delicioso aroma cafetero de esta bella tierra.\n\n*Descubre las haciendas cafeteras colombianas, una de las herencias coloniales más coloridas del Paisaje Cultural Cafetero:\nLas haciendas son uno de los elementos arquitectónicos más característicos de la cultura cafetera, herencia de los antioqueños. Conocerás la historia que encierra la hacienda mientras degustas un verdadero café colombiano de bienvenida.\n\n*Pueblos cafeteros con encanto: \nSi eres un apasionado de la cultura, la historia, la tradición y sientes debilidad por la arquitectura colonial y sobre todo por el café, no dejes escapar esta oportunidad, adéntrate en los más bonitos pueblos cafeteros colombianos y déjate cautivar por los vivos colores de sus fachadas, su arquitectura antioqueña, sus costumbres y gentes.\n\n*Introdúcete en un mundo de colores e historias inolvidables:\nEl paisaje cultural cafetero no sólo se nutre de cafetales y paisajes para obtener su reconocimiento mundial, sino también de sus encantadores pueblos que han conseguido conservar la magia intacta de una época colonial pasada. \n\n*Sorpréndete con los pueblos cafeteros más emblemáticos:\nDéjate maravillar por los encantos de Aguadas, pueblo célebre por su artesanía donde se inició la colonización antioqueña; Salamina, más conocida como la ciudad de la luz por los diferentes poetas, músicos, actores y escritores que ha visto nacer; Riosucio, popular por su carnaval del diablo cuya historia te asombrará; Santuario, conocida como la

hacer- Que conocer. Que ver en el eje cafetero y el paisaje cultural cafetero.\n\n*Paisaje cafetero en transportes auténticos:\nVive el Paisaje de una forma distinta, a bordo de un Jeep Willys, de un \"Karpati\", de una Chiva de vivos colores o incluso de un jeep panorámico. Estos transportes te permitirán recorrer fácilmente las tierras cafeteras mientras descubres el origen de una taza de café, conoces pueblos con encanto y admiras el maravilloso e inconfundible paisaje de los cafetales. \n\n*Siéntete como uno más en el desfile de «Yipaos»:\nSi viajas en junio o julio tendrás la oportunidad única de contemplar decenas de «yipaos» desfilando por las calles de Calarcá, una población pintoresca que baila al son de los rugidos de los «Jeep Willys». Podrás ver las diferentes cargas que pueden llevar los yipaos», desde productos como el café o plátanos hasta muebles, plantas y mascotas. Diviértete viendo el concurso del «pique», donde «yipaos» cargados hasta los topes se ponen a dos ruedas para recorrer unos metros y arrancar aplausos del público.\n\n*Manizales, mirador de tierras cafeteras:\nEn Manizales literalmente sentirás que estás andando sobre una cuchilla, con calles en prolongadas pendientes a ambos lados, y es que es un mirador natural perfecto. Sube al Corredor Polaco de la Catedral y obtendrás una espectacular visual de 360º de los paisajes que la rodean. Pasea y relájate por la Avda. 12 de Octubre o acércate a cualquiera de los varios EcoParques que rodean la ciudad.\n\n*Descubre Manizales, una ciudad moderna en el seno del universo cafetero:\nForjada entre montañas y valles, Manizales emerge como una ciudad repleta de vida, cultura y naturaleza, donde sus cálidas gentes te darán la bienvenida por donde quiera que vayas.

hacer- Que conocer. Que ver en el eje cafetero y el paisaje cultural cafetero.\n\n*Disfrutar de la naturaleza y paisajes únicos:\nEsta región está atravesada por la cordillera de los Andes lo que te permite ascender a más de 4.000 metros de altura. Si eres un amante de la naturaleza, podrás disfrutar de paisajes únicos y practicar una amplia variedad de actividades con distintos niveles de dificultad. En el Paisaje Cultural Cafetero de Colombia observarás paisajes volcánicos y ecosistemas tan singulares como el páramo. Este telón de fondo es también un paraíso para las aves, con más de 1.000 especies.\n\n*Las palmas más altas del planeta:\nEl mero hecho de estar en el Valle del Cocora o el Bosque de la Samaria te hará sentir un privilegiado. El paisaje, incomparable, este bosque sobre bosque, como solía decir Alexander Von Humbolt, te traslada a una era remota, casi esperando que un ser extinto aparezca rugiendo de entre la bruma. Las palmas, especie en vía de extinción, de hasta 60 m, esbeltas y desafiantes te invitan a adentrarte en su misterio y descubrir un escenario repleto de vida y un abanico de parajes.\nSúbete a bordo de un «Yipao» en el coqueto pueblo de Salento\nSalento es un auténtico pueblo cafetero con encanto, con sus coloridos balcones y bonitas tiendas. Dirígete al Mirador Alto de la Cruz, que te regalará una espectacular vista del Valle, dejándote sin palabras. Súbete a un «Yipao» y dirígete al impresionante Valle del Cocora.\n\n*Pasea entre gigantes y descubre a los más pequeños:\nA pie o a caballo, seguirás agradables senderos que te situarán al lado de altísimas palmas, que son al mismo tiempo madrinas de especies amenazadas como el loro orejiamarillo. Te dirigirás a la Reserva la Montaña, donde podrás entrar en contacto con su ecosistema rico en flora y fauna. La Montaña es un mirador natural de este paisaje único y del misterioso Cerro Morrogacho. Otra excelente opción es continuar adentrándose en el bosque de niebla hasta llegar a la Reserva Natural de Acaime, conocida por sus coloridos colibríes, bromelias, orquideas, helechos y otras aves.\n\n*Si buscas aventura, sube al misterioso Morrogacho:\nSi puedes quedarte dos días, continúa hasta la Estación Biológica Estrella de Agua, alójate en su centro de visitantes y despiértate con el susurro de las aves. Recorre sus senderos y entra en contacto con el ecosistema.\nSi prefieres una experiencia más exigente físicamente, la travesía al Cerro Morrogacho (3.450m), escenario previo al Parque Los Nevados, no te defraudará.

hacer- Que conocer. Que ver en el eje cafetero y el paisaje cultural cafetero.\n\n*Santuarios únicos de flora y fauna:\nEl río Otún es madre de toda vida en esta cuenca hidrográfica, en donde se ubican el Santuario de Fauna y Flora Otún Quimbaya y el Parque Natural Regional Ucumarí. En estos paraísos descubrirás que existen los milagros, cuando en medio del bosque de niebla te sorprenda el gigante de las aves de la zona, la \"Pava Caucana\", especie que se creía extinta. Aprenderás sobre la fragilidad de estos ecosistemas y a conservarlos mientras te deleitas refrescándote en bellas cascadas.\n\n*Sumérgete en el paraíso de las aves, flora y otras especies cautivadoras:\nTe adentrarás en senderos ecológicos que discurren por el misterioso bosque subandino, hipnotizado por la melodía del Cucarachero Flautista y el Comprapan, los colores vivos de las Tangaras o la llamada de los Monos Aulladores. Tu guía se asegurará de que no te pierdas ni un detalle: orquídeas, bromelias, mariposas, etc., entrando en contacto con todos ellos y pasando a formar parte del equilibrio de todo lo que te rodea.\n\n*Siente la vida brotar en bellos paisajes de ríos y cascadas, a pie y en bicicleta:\nSi eres más aventurero, podrás poner a prueba tus capacidades y descubrir nuevos escenarios energizantes del bosque subandino, disfrutando con la belleza natural de la cuenca del Río Otún. Entre senderos, ríos y cascadas, recorrerás en bicicleta una ruta de 6 km hasta el Cedral.\n\n*Disfruta de una romántica velada y despiértate con el canto de las aves:\nLa experiencia continua en el Centro de Visitantes Otún Quimbaya, donde, si lo deseas, te agasajarán con una cena romántica de tu elección a la luz de velas. Otra opción es una charla en buena compañía, rememorando las anécdotas del día. Por la mañana experimentarás un dulce despertar con un delicioso café y almuerzo colombiano, los sonidos de los monos aulladores y los cantos de las aves.\n\n*Recorre un sendero paisajístico hasta el espectacular Parque de Ucumarí:\nTras la experiencia en el SFF Otún Quimbaya, recomendamos no perderse la experiencia en el Parque Natural de Ucumarí, lugar que debe su nombre al Oso de Anteojos, que en Quechua es «ucu» o «ucumarí» y al que se llega tras una caminata de 6 km desde El Cedral al Centro de Visitantes La Pastora. Este camino se puede hacer a pie, o a caballo. Aquí vivirás una experiencia de explorador, avistando gran variedad de especies de flora y fauna, algunas únicas en el planeta y otras nuevas para la ciencia. Este parque te regalará postales de bellísimas caídas de agua como las de La Pastora y Santa Lucía, al mismo tiempo que sumerges tus sentidos en la riqueza biológica del ecosistema de bosque andino.\n\n*Tranquilidad, risas alrededor de una buena chimenea y dulces sueños:\nSi lo deseas podrás alojarte en el propio parque, donde compartir anécdotas y risas alrededor de una acogedora chimenea, ya que no hay luz eléctrica, y degustar alguno de los deliciosos platos que te preparará el chef Reinel Suárez. Nada perturbará tu sueño ya que estas en la selva…y no hay señal de

hacer- Que conocer. Que ver en el eje cafetero y el paisaje cultural cafetero.\n\n*Territorio inexplorado:\nDe camino al bello pueblo de Santuario te encontrarás con hermosos paisajes y sorpresas muy dulces. Santuario, con su colorida arquitectura, te recibirá con los brazos abiertos, justo antes de adentrarte en otro tipo de santuarios, los de la naturaleza inexplorada, como Planes de San Rafael y el Parque Nacional Tatamá. Si quieres sentirte un explorador, aquí hay una experiencia para ti.\n\n*Deléitate con el paisaje y endúlzate con sabrosas frutas tropicales:\nInicias el viaje entre verdes paisajes, cultivos de piña, caña de azúcar, café y redondeadas colinas. Al llegar a Cerritos, podrás endulzar tu paladar con alguna de las sabrosas piñas o dulces que te ofrecerán.\n\n*Disfruta de postales cafeteras de camino al bonito pueblo de Santuario:\nTu camino discurre por pronunciadas laderas llenas de cafetales, que ofrecen hermosas panorámicas de los valles de los ríos Mapa y Risaralda. El bello pueblo de Santuario te sorprenderá con sus coquetos balcones y coloridas fachadas.\n\n*Despiértate y vigorízate en el Parque Planes de San Rafael:\nAlójate en su cómodo centro de visitantes y despiértate al ritmo del sonido de las aves. Te recibirán con un buen desayuno típico elaborado por el buen hacer de las señoras de fincas vecinas al Parque. Tras el desayuno, escoge el nivel de dificultad del sendero que deseas realizar.

hacer- Que conocer. Que ver en el eje cafetero y el paisaje cultural cafetero.\n*Parque Natural Nacional Los Nevados, exclusivos paisajes de alta montaña\nSi eres madrugador, desde el centro de visitantes El Cisne tendrás inolvidables imágenes del Nevado del Ruiz, el cráter de La Olleta, el Paramillo del Cisne y el Nevado de Santa Isabel. En el Bosque del Edén, sobre la carretera hacia la Laguna del Otún, conseguirás una fantástica postal de páramo y graciosos frailejones, mientras que en Aguacerales podrás fotografiar un espectacular colchón de agua! También, subiendo por el Páramo de Letras, hacia el Parque, podrás obtener una buena vista de un bosque de niebla permanente y muy denso. Son tantas las postales que puede regalar este lugar!\n\n*Santuario y sus alrededores, cafetales en escarpadas laderas\nDiscurrir por los caminos que llevan al coqueto pueblo de Santuario y a otras poblaciones como Apía, La Celia o Pueblo Rico es sinónimo de inolvidables postales de verdes y frondosos cafetales ubicados en escarpadas laderas, cuya recolección supone un verdadero desafío para recolectores y chapoleras.\n\n*Miradores del Valle\nEl Mirador del Valle, cercano a Ansermanuevo, brinda panorámicas del Valle del Cauca y el Quindío, mientras que el encantador pueblo de El Cairo, a más altura, complementa estas postales cafeteras.\n\n*Relajarse en plena naturaleza:\nRelájate en un entorno de ensueño, rodeado de naturaleza pura donde el silencio sólo se ve interrumpido por el sonido de las aguas termales que brotan de la tierra y descienden por potentes cascadas a temperaturas que superan los 40º. Sumérgete en las fuentes naturales del Paisaje Cultural Cafetero y renueva tu cuerpo, espíritu y mente. No dejes que te lo cuenten, vívelo!\n\n*Descubre una de las facetas menos conocida del Paisaje Cultural:\nEl Paisaje Cultural Cafetero se presenta también como un lugar mágico donde el agua, la tierra y la naturaleza se convierten en un solo elemento, ofreciendo un escenario privilegiado para descansar, relajarse y meditar.
