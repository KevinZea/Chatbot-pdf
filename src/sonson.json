Antioquia, Colombia\n\nSonsón está ubicado en la subregión oriente del departamento, a 115 kilómetros de la ciudad de Medellín y tiene una temperatura promedio de 13 grados centígrados.\nEste es el municipio más extenso de todo el oriente antioqueño y cuenta con todos los pisos térmicos ya que tiene el Páramo de Sonsón, cuyo punto más alto está ubicado a los 3.350 metros sobre el nivel del mar y también tiene parte de su territorio sobre el Magdalena Medio.\nSi bien todos los municipios del departamento tienen una rica historia, en Sonsón hay una gran participación en la colonización antioqueña hacia el viejo Caldas, Cauca y Valle del Cauca, además ha sido cuna de personajes ilustres como escritores, gobernadores, ministros y hasta héroes de la historia independentista del país.\nSu riqueza cultural se relata en el Centro Histórico y también en diferentes museos como la Casa de los Abuelos que conserva las tradiciones ancestrales, el Museo de Arte Religioso, Museo Pablo Jaramillo, la Sala Arqueológica Sonsón, el Museo Folclórico entre otros, pero no solo en su cabecera urbana, porque también cuenta con la Sala Arqueológica Pantágoras en el corregimiento de San Miguel.\nMás allá de sus museos también se relata la historia, porque en el Parque Cementerio San José incluso, se encuentra literatura, ya que tiene como particularidad que a su entrada se encuentra una placa con una frase del escritor Gregorio Gutierrez González, oriundo del municipio y que dice:\n“Aquí no se descansa ni se duerme, Que «morir no es dormir y no es soñar», aquí sólo reposa el polvo inerte; pero el alma… buscadla más allá. Mas venid a rogar por el ausente; para toda plegaria hay un altar, y la fe, la oración, hallan fervientes, consuelo siempre, decepción jamás.”\nTradicionalmente se ha conocido como la Tierra del Maíz y de hecho en agosto se celebran sus fiestas, para que propios y extraños los acompañen y visiten, llenando todo el municipio con experiencias musicales, desfiles que cuentan su tradición y eventos culturales de todos los tipos.\nEn este municipio hay diferentes lugares ecológicos que se destacan por su abundante naturaleza, cuenta con los senderos del Cerro el Capiro, al Cerro de la Vieja y de la quebrada Santa Mónica, recorridos a la Gruta de los Guácharos, a las higueras de la Vereda La Loma y El Brasil, así como también a Rio Arriba y al mismo Páramo.\nAdemás de los productos del maíz que son reconocidos, es recomendable preguntar por las famosas gelatinas de
